        <ul><strong>∙ 1 1/2 cups if all-purpose flour</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 3 tablespoons of sugar</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1 tablespoon of baking powder</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1/4 teapsoon of salt</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1/8 teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 2 large eggs, at room temperature</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1 1/4 cups of milk, at room temperature</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter</strong></ul>

        <h4>You can find the instructions below:</h4>

        <ol><strong>1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a 
        thick batter is just formed.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. 
        Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, 
        and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve 
        immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter 
        to the skillet as needed.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with 
        sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.</strong></ol>
