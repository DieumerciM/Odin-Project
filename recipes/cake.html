        <h1>Jay's Most Underated Cake Recipe</h1>

        <h3><em>This is the best recipe for cake I've ever made. It's
        a shame no one would give it the time of day, but now you have 
        access to it. So please do my recipe justice.</em></h3>

        <img src="../images/cake.jpg">
        
        <h4>The ingredients needed in this recipe are:</h3>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1 cup of unsalted butter(2 sticks), room temperature,
        plus more for pans</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pans</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1 teaspoon of salt</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1 1/2 cups of sugar</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 2 large eggs</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 3 large egg yolks</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ 1 cup of low-fat buttermilk</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>∙ whipped frosting</strong></ul>

        <h4>And now for the instructions, follow the instructions down below</h4>

        <ol><strong>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour two 8-by-2-inch 
        cake pans, tapping out excess flour. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, 
        baking soda, and salt.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>2. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar until 
        light and fluffy. With mixer on low, beat in eggs and yolks, one at a time. Beat in 
        vanilla. Alternately beat in flour mixture and buttermilk, beginning and ending with 
        flour mixture; mix just until combined.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>3. Divide batter between pans; smooth tops. Bake until cakes pull away from 
        sides of pans, 32 to 35 minutes. Let cool in pans 10 minutes. Run a knife around edges of 
        pans and invert cakes onto a wire rack. Let cool completely.</strong></ol>

        <ol><strong>Place one cake, bottom side up, on a cake stand. Tuck strips of parchment paper 
        underneath. Using an offset-spatula or table knife, spread top with whipped frosting. Top with 
        remaining cake; frost top, then sides.</strong></ol>
